# Craigslist-classifier

The three algorithms we used here are:

Linear SVC - Linear support vector classification
SVC is to fit to the data you provide, returning a best fit that divides, or categorizes, your data.
Multinomial NB - Multinomial Naive Bayes
It is suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification).
Random forest classifier 
Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees.

Confusion matrix - A confusion matrix is a summary of the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by a classifier.
